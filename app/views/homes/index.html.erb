<p>“Hey, why don’t we build a pizza oven in the backyard?” The founder’s girlfriend said to him one day, and in an attempt to make her wish come true,
he gathered his friends at his home in Tokyo and decided to build a pizza oven. This was the very beginning of our restaurant</p>

<p>What kind of place makes people want to come back again and again?

Is it something different from your day-to-day life,
that makes your heart dance?
Is it a comfortable place where you can take a breath and relax?
Glorious Restaurant strives to be both of those things
- a place where you can feel the excitement of being away from the ordinary,
yet feel comfortable at the same time.

This is why we put a lot of time and effort into designing our space
– why our commitment goes beyond our food.

We strive to always be new with designs that amaze,
but also to be a relaxing place that makes you want to stay for hours.
Glorious Restaurant hopes to ultimately be your “Special Oasis”.</p>
